# Flag Party — the live multiplayer show

Working document for the party-game mode. This is a **program feature** with its own
tracker (Now / phases / Done, same conventions as `FEATURE.md`), kept separate so it
doesn't bloat `FEATURE.md`. A fresh agent picking this up should read `CLAUDE.md`, then
this file, then continue the first uncompleted step under `## Now`.

**Branching:** each phase = one branch off `main` + one PR. `git checkout main && git pull`
before `git checkout -b`. Don't auto-merge — Jan merges each PR himself.

## The idea

It's **not three games — it's one party show with swappable rounds.** Jackbox/Kahoot,
but for flags. The mini-games (flag-pick, map, superlative, find-the-match) are *rounds*;
the real product is the **shared scoreboard** that runs across them.

This reframing is load-bearing:

- **"One game or three?"** → one show, rounds are plug-ins. Ship one round first; add
  rounds over time without touching the show engine.
- **"Solo or multiplayer?"** → don't fork the code. **Solo is a 1-seat game.** Every round
  scores on its own (correctness + your own speed + closeness). Multiplayer is the same
  rounds with N seats plus a *first-place speed bonus*. Solo = the show with one seat and
  the race bonus off. This is why the superlative round works alone *and* against friends
  from one codebase.

## Player model — own-screen players, TV optional later (decided 2026-07-09)

**Every device is a full player: it shows the question *and* takes the answer.** Two people
grab two phones and play — no TV, no second screen required. Solo is the same thing with one
device. This is the foundation.

The key realization: the server broadcasts the **same** question to every connection
(`{ prompt, options }`, answer withheld). "Two phones" vs "shared TV + buzzers" differ only
in **whether a device draws the flags or just draws buttons** — a client-side role, not a
different engine. So three roles fall out of one architecture, and we never have to marry a
model:

- **Full player** — shows the question and takes input (a phone on its own, or a PC). *This
  is the base, and all of iteration 1.*
- **Display** — shows the question, takes no input (the optional TV). *Next option, below.*
- **Buzzer** — shows buttons only, pairs with a Display (the Jackbox phone). *Ships with the
  Display option.*

**Flow (2 phones + solo):**

1. Phone 1 opens `/flagParty/`, taps **Create** → gets a room code + shareable link + QR,
   waits in the lobby.
2. Phone 2 opens the link (or enters the code) → joins the lobby. **No name-entry step** —
   the nickname is read from the existing profile (`gridgame.nickname` via
   `flags/nickname.js`, with the deterministic default when unset).
3. Either player starts (solo: start with one seat, first-place bonus off).
4. Each round: **both phones show** the prompt + 4 flags. Both tap. The server orders the
   buzzes and reveals the answer + points on both. On reveal each player sees **everyone's
   pick** (the "oh, we both said France" moment) plus the updated scoreboard.
5. After 5 rounds: final board on both. Play again.

Why own-screen first, not Jackbox: no TV dependency, solo falls out for free, 2-player is
the main case, and it's **one player page** instead of a host page *plus* a controller page.

## Ship-dark behind `?test` (decided 2026-07-09)

The mode ships to prod immediately but stays invisible: a 5th tile is added to the home
grid, rendered `hidden`, and revealed by `bootHome()` only when the URL carries `?test`
(`new URLSearchParams(location.search).has('test')`). Lets us dogfood on the real site
(real PartyKit, real phones) without exposing a half-built mode to visitors. Flip to
always-visible by deleting the guard when a round set is ready.

## What we reuse (already built)

| Piece | Source | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Room scaffolding: codes, seats, presence, reconnect, broadcast, serialize-to-storage | `flags/onlineRoom.js` + PartyKit (pattern) | The show's room, generalised from 2 roles → N seats |
| Flag-pick question generator (lookalike-aware distractors) | `flags/quiz.js` `pickQuestion(pool, 4)` | The flag-pick round, server-side |
| Find-a-flag-matching-a-rule engine | `flags/findFlag.js` | The find-the-match round |
| Country contour rendering | `flagQuiz/flagMap.js` + `worldMap.svg` | The map round |
| Country data (colors, motifs, continent, statehood) | `flags/countries.json` (269 entries) | Round generation |
| Nickname (default + stored) | `flags/nickname.js`, `gridgame.nickname` | Player name — **no name-entry step** |

**What we genuinely don't have:** quantitative country data (population, area, world-cup
wins, coffee output, border lengths). The **superlative round** ("pick the biggest of these
16") is gated on populating this — the single biggest new-work item in the vision. Tracked
as a data effort when that round comes up (see roadmap); it's independently useful for daily
/ TTT, so it pays off beyond the show.

## Architecture

- **A dedicated PartyKit party.** Register a new party in `partykit.json`
  (`parties: { ..., party: "party/partyGameServer.js" }`) so show rooms live in their own
  namespace, fully separate from TTT. Server file is thin (mirrors `party/server.js`).
- **Pure room logic in `flags/`, tested.** `flags/partyRoom.js` owns create / join (N seats,
  host seat) / start-round / record-buzz / reveal / tally / next-round / final — same
  "pure module + `*.test.js`" split as `onlineRoom.js`. The server file is a shell.
- **Round contract (the plug-in point):**
  ```
  {
    id: 'flagPick',
    generate(pool, rng) -> { prompt, options[], answer },  // answer stays server-side
    isCorrect(question, buzz) -> boolean,
  }
  ```
  `generate` produces what the players need; the **answer is never sent to clients** — the
  server holds it and only reveals after the round. `options` render in a fixed order so
  every player's flag N is the same flag. Adding a round = adding one module that satisfies
  this contract. Rendering lives in the page layer.
- **Buzz-order is authoritative, for free.** PartyKit processes a room's messages serially
  in the Durable Object, so the order the server *receives* correct buzzes IS "who was
  first" — no client clocks, no timestamp trust (same property TTT uses for turns).
- **Reveal carries every player's pick.** The reveal broadcast includes what each seat
  chose, so clients can show "you / them" side by side, not just a private right/wrong.
- **Scoring in `flags/partyScore.js`, pure + tested.** v1: correct = +10; first correct
  = +5 decaying (2nd +3, 3rd +1, rest +0); wrong = 0. Solo: correctness only, no first-bonus.

## Roadmap

Two independent axes: **rounds** (content) and **surfaces** (how people connect). Ship
along both incrementally.

### Rounds (each reuses an engine except superlative, which needs data first)

| # | Round | Reuses | New data? | Solo-scorable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Flag pick** (which flag is X? — 1 of 4, race) | `quiz.js` | no | ✅ |
| 2 | **Find-the-match** (buzz a flag matching a rule; obscure-pick bonus) | `findFlag.js` | no | ✅ |
| 3 | **Map: name the contour** | `flagMap.js` | no | ✅ |
| 4 | **Superlative** (biggest / most-coffee of 16; closeness score) | new UI | **yes — blocker** | ✅ |
| — | **Neighbours** (who borders X?) | — | borders list | ✅ |

Order rationale: rounds 1–3 need **no new data** and each reuses an engine. The superlative
round is the soul of the idea but gated on data population, so it lands after the show engine
is proven and the free rounds are in.

### Surfaces

- **Own-screen full players** — *iteration 1.* Solo, 2 phones, N phones. No TV.
- **TV / shared-screen display (next option).** Add a **Display** role: open `/flagParty/`
  on a TV/PC and it renders the room's question + live scoreboard without playing, so a
  roomful of people can look up at one screen while their phones become trimmed **Buzzers**
  (buttons only). Cheap to add because the server already broadcasts the full question to
  every connection — it's a new client role, not a protocol change. This is the Jackbox
  layer, added on top once own-screen play works.

## Iteration 1 — the show skeleton with one round (flag-pick), own-screen — SHIPPED (branch `feat/flag-party-iter1`)

Goal: a genuinely playable flag round on two phones (and solo), exercising the **entire**
engine so rounds 2–4 and the TV surface are pure additions afterward.

- [x] **Home tile, ship-dark.** 5th `.game-tile` in `index.html` → `flagParty/`, `hidden`
      by default; `bootHome()` reveals it when `?test` is present. `tile.party` i18n key.
- [x] **PartyKit party + pure room module.** Registered `party` in `partykit.json`;
      `party/partyGameServer.js` (thin) + `flags/partyRoom.js` (pure: seats, host, start,
      buzz-order, reveal-with-all-picks, tally, next, final, play-again→lobby) + tests.
- [x] **Round contract + flag-pick round.** `flags/partyRounds/flagPick.js` (`generate` via
      `pickQuestion` + `isCorrect`), tested. `flags/partyScore.js` (decaying speed bonus,
      off in solo), tested. `flags/partyClient.js` (client reducer), tested.
- [x] **Shared lobby helpers promoted** to `flags/roomNet.js` (code + WS URL), re-exported
      from `ticTacToe/onlineClient.js`; tests moved to `flags/roomNet.test.js`.
- [x] **Player page** (`flagParty/index.html` + `page.js` + `index.css`) — one page for
      create + join: Create → lobby (code + invite link + roster) or Join via `?room=CODE`
      → Start → per-round (prompt + 4 flags, tap, locked-in) → reveal (correct flag +
      everyone's pick + points + scoreboard) → final board → Play again. Nickname from
      `gridgame.nickname`. en + pl i18n (`party.*`).
- [x] `npm run validate` green + end-to-end verified in-browser (solo run through 5 rounds).

**Bugs the end-to-end verify caught** (unit tests alone missed both): (1) *Play again* left the
client stuck on the final board — the server only broadcast `roster`, which carries no phase;
fixed with a dedicated `lobby` message the client acts on. (2) All phase sections stacked on
screen at once — `.party section { display: flex }` outweighed the UA `[hidden]` rule; fixed
with `.party section[hidden] { display: none }`. Both now pinned (unit test + the CSS rule's
own comment).

**Deferred from iteration 1** (deviations from the mockup, deliberately): the **QR code** in
the lobby — v1 ships the room code + an invite-link/share button (a 5-letter code is fine to
read aloud in the same room); QR is a fast follow. Also: rounds 2–4, the TV/Display surface,
quantitative data, persisted scores / leaderboards (the show is ephemeral), more than one
round *type*, spectators.

**Confirmed UI decisions (2026-07-09, from the mockup):** A — flags on the phone in a 2×2
grid; B — correct = secondary (pink) ring + check, wrong = dimmed, no green/red (on the seven
palette colours); C — reveal shows everyone's pick (avatar on the chosen flag); D — first
correct tagged "⚡ Fastest", full scoreboard only on reveal/final. Name: **Flag Party**
(folder `flagParty/`; pl tile "Flagowa impreza").

## Iteration 2 — sovereign + non-sovereign segments — SHIPPED (branch `feat/party-nonsovereign-mode`)

One game is now **10 rounds: 5 sovereign flag-pick, then 5 non-sovereign flag-pick**, same
mechanic, pool swaps at round 6. Settings page (host picks modes + rounds-per-mode) is still
future; this hardcodes the default plan.

- `flags/partyPlan.js` — the game plan as **data**: `DEFAULT_PLAN = [{sovereign,5},{nonSovereign,5}]`
  + `totalRounds` + `poolIdForRound`. This is the seed of the settings page — it will just
  edit this array. Tested.
- `flags/flagPools.js` — `sovereignPool` (195) and `nonSovereignPool` (54). The non-sovereign
  pool is territories + quasi-states + subnational regions (Jan's "everything non-sovereign",
  2026-07-09), with orgs dropped (`category === 'country'`) and **parent-flag duplicates**
  excluded via `SHARED_PARENT_FLAG` — the flags that read as their parent's (French tricolor
  territories, Svalbard/Bouvet = Norway, US Minor Outlying = US flag, Heard & McDonald =
  Australia's flag). Verified by eye against the SVGs, not just `quiz.js` LOOKALIKES (which
  omits Heard and US Minor Outlying). Pinned by a test so a broken "which flag is Mayotte →
  French tricolor" question can't slip in.
- `flagPick.generate(pool, exclude)` — takes a used-answer set so a game doesn't repeat a
  country; the server tracks `usedCodes`, reset on start / play-again.
- Server maps `poolId → pool` and generates each round from the right one.

Verified end-to-end: round 1 = a sovereign flag, round 6 = "which flag is Norfolk Island?"
with all-non-sovereign distinct options. `npm run validate` green.

## Iteration 3 — the clock: countdown + hands-free transitions — SHIPPED (branch `feat/party-round-clock`)

The core loop now *feels* like a race, and it advances on its own — **no host button to press.**

- `flags/partyTiming.js` (pure + tested) — the show's pace as data + arithmetic:
  `QUESTION_SECONDS = 15`, `REVEAL_SECONDS = 6`, plus `secondsLeft` (ceil + clamp, so it
  reads the full duration on a fresh deadline and only hits 0 at true expiry) and
  `remainingFraction` (clamped [0,1] for the shrinking bar).
- **Every client renders a countdown bar**; the **host's timer is authoritative** for the
  transition (matching how the room already treats the host as the only seat that can
  start / advance). When a question's clock runs out the host sends `reveal`; when a reveal
  has lingered the host sends `next`. Both messages are ignored by the reducer if the phase
  already moved on, so the existing all-present-buzzed auto-reveal races safely against the
  timer.
- **The "Next round" button is gone.** After a reveal lingers `REVEAL_SECONDS` the next
  round starts by itself; the bar shows "next round in N" (`party.nextIn`, replaced the now
  dead `party.nextRound`). The last round's reveal auto-advances to the final board the same
  way.
- **The room reducer did not change** — timing lives on the page by design; the room stays
  time-free and only knows "reveal now" / "next now" (`applyForceReveal` / `applyNext`,
  already present). No wire-protocol change either: clients import the durations directly.

**Known limitation (documented, not yet fixed):** the pace depends on the **host's tab
staying awake**. If the host disconnects mid-round the room can stall at a reveal (a
non-host has no authority to send `next`). Two future fixes, both out of scope here:
server-side PartyKit **alarms** driving the transitions (robust, survives any tab), or
**host migration** on disconnect. Also cosmetic: a player who *reconnects* mid-question
starts a fresh full-length bar rather than the real remaining time — the host's
authoritative reveal still corrects them on schedule.

## Iteration 4 — Round 2: the Map round (own-screen) — SHIPPED (branch `feat/party-map-round`)

Goal: the **second round type** ("which outline is X?"), which is what turns this from "a
flag quiz with a scoreboard" into the swappable-round *show* the vision describes. The server
stops hardwiring flag-pick and starts **picking round modules from the plan**. It's the
**mirror of flag-pick**: identical data shape, same 2×2 grid, same buzz-order + scoring — only
the tiles render country **contours** instead of flags.

**The plan (the default game becomes 11 rounds):** 3 sovereign flag-pick → 3 non-sovereign
flag-pick → 5 map (sovereign pool). Nice arc: familiar flags, harder flags, then a mode switch
to shapes for the finale. A future host-picks-modes settings page will edit this; for now it's
the hardcoded default in `flags/partyPlan.js`.

**Decisions (2026-07-10):**

- **One module per round type.** Round modules live in `flags/partyRounds/<id>.js` (the existing
  `flagPick.js` pattern), each satisfying the `{ generate, isCorrect }` contract, wired through a
  small `ROUNDS` registry in the server. Adding a mode = one new file + one registry line, nothing
  else touched. Chosen deliberately because the mode set will keep growing (superlative, neighbours,
  find-the-match, …).
- **Contours are pre-generated assets, not runtime-rendered.** Each country gets a normalized,
  tile-ready silhouette at `flags/contours/<code>.svg`, so the map round renders
  `<img src="flags/contours/xx.svg">` — the literal mirror of flag-pick's
  `<img src="flags/svg/xx.svg">`. The client difference between the two rounds collapses to
  **"swap the folder"**: same grid, same lazy-load, same CDN cache/warm story, and zero runtime
  path-extraction or per-tile bbox math (the cheapest render, scales to N players × 4 tiles for
  free). Pre-generation is also the **curation gate** — we only generate recognizable geometry, so
  the map pool becomes exactly "the set we generated"; microstates (unreadable dots at tile size)
  get no file and never appear.
- **The asset source is decoupled from the client.** Because the client only ever sees
  `contours/xx.svg`, the generator's *input* can change without touching a line of round code.
  Start from `flagQuiz/worldMap.svg` — its detail is already proven, since flagQuiz's map game
  recognizes countries by that same geometry — and if tile-size detail disappoints, regenerate from
  Natural Earth 1:50m with the client unchanged. **Gate: sample ~6 contours (easy / medium /
  small) at tile size and eyeball them before mass-generating.**
- **Per-round hint.** A small label above the grid — "Which flag is X?" vs "Which outline is X?"
  — so players know which they're tapping. New `party.*` i18n (en + pl).

**Build steps:**

- [x] **Sample + lock the source.** Sampled contours (easy / medium / small) from `worldMap.svg`
      at tile size — detail is plenty, **worldMap wins**, no Natural Earth needed.
- [x] **Contour asset set + generator.** `scripts/generate-contours.mjs` emits `flags/contours/<code>.svg`
      (mainland-clustered, square padded viewBox) for every sovereign code with usable geometry.
      **157 contours** define the map pool (`flags/contourPool.js`); ru / fj / sb hand-excluded,
      microstates size-gated. Assets + generator + `contourPool.test.js` checked in.
- [x] **Round registry + plan generalization.** `flags/partyPlan.js`: segments gained `roundId` +
      `roundIdForRound`; `DEFAULT_PLAN` → the 3 / 3 / 5 split. `party/partyGameServer.js`: a
      `ROUNDS` registry keyed by each module's `id`, picked via `roundIdForRound`; the broadcast
      question carries `roundId` (stamped server-side). `flags/partyClient.js` threads it through. Tested.
- [x] **`flags/partyRounds/mapPick.js`** (+ test) — `generate(pool, exclude, rng)` / `isCorrect`,
      same shape as flag-pick; narrows any pool to `CONTOUR_CODE_SET`, MVP distractors = 4 random
      distinct codes, injectable RNG for deterministic tests.
- [x] **Page rendering.** `flagParty/page.js` branches on `question.roundId`: map renders `.contour`
      `<img>` tiles from `flags/contours/` (the literal "swap the folder" mirror). Locked-in ring,
      reveal pulse, pick-avatars, scoring unchanged. Per-round hint label added (`party.hintFlag` /
      `party.hintMap`, en + pl).
- [x] `npm run validate` green (2180 tests) + **end-to-end verified in-browser** — solo run reached
      round 7 ("Which outline? Panama"), tapped a contour, saw the mirror-of-flag-pick reveal
      (Panama green-pulse, wrong pick pink + avatar, others dimmed).

**Deferred (not this iteration):** shape-similar ("hard") distractors; non-sovereign contours; the
host settings page (still just edits `DEFAULT_PLAN` when it lands); the higher-detail Natural Earth
source (only if the worldMap sampling forces it).

**Perf: contour set halved (done, same PR).** The raw worldMap geometry carried full source
precision (2+ decimals of a viewBox unit) that's sub-pixel at the ~150 px the tiles render —
coastline-heavy outlines were the worst (Canada 147 KB, US 68 KB). The generator now runs every
contour through SVGO's `convertPathData` at 1-decimal precision (a *proper* relative-path
simplification — a naive regex round would drift over a 20k-point path). Set went **874 KB → 382 KB
(avg 5.5 KB → 2.4 KB)**, Canada 147 → 57 KB, US 68 → 26 KB, with no visible change at tile size
(heavy tiles re-eyeballed). Build-time only — `svgo` + `playwright-core` are devDeps of the
generator; the runtime/client never changed, and the code set (`contourPool.js`) is byte-identical.

## Open decisions (settle as they come up, not now)

- **Settings page** (Jan wants one eventually): host picks which modes and how many rounds
  each. `flags/partyPlan.js` is already the config surface — the page edits `DEFAULT_PLAN`.
- **QR in the lobby.** Deferred from iteration 1 (see above) — add a self-contained QR
  generator, or accept code + link.
- **Question count / timing per round.** 11 rounds (3 flag / 3 flag / 5 map, per `DEFAULT_PLAN`).
  Per-question countdown landed in iteration 3 (`flags/partyTiming.js`, host-driven,
  hands-free advance); question time is `QUESTION_SECONDS = 20`. **Reveal pace is decided
  and deliberately *not* configurable** (see the reveal-pace note under Done): it's keyed on
  correctness, not a dial. If pace ever becomes a setting it should be one overall fast/normal
  feel, not raw per-phase seconds.
- **Speed-bonus curve.** Currently decaying (+5/+3/+1) in `flags/partyScore.js`.
- **Max seats.** No hard cap in the room module; 2 is the tested case.

## Out of scope (don't sweep in)

- Persistent competitive leaderboards for the show (it's a live party, not a ranked ladder).
- Accounts / auth beyond the existing deviceId + nickname.
- Non-flag domains (movies/books) — the round contract is domain-shaped, but that's the
  long-term-vision hub, not this feature.

## Done

- **Reveal pace — correctness-keyed, no reveal timer.** The reveal used to freeze the bar full
  and count "Next round in Ns" (weird for a sub-2s beat; in solo the digit never even
  decremented). Now the reveal length is keyed on the round, not the room: `isCleanReveal`
  (`flags/partyClient.js`) is true when every *present* player picked the answer, and
  `revealSecondsFor(clean)` returns `CLEAN_REVEAL_SECONDS = 0.9` vs `MISS_REVEAL_SECONDS = 2.5`
  (`flags/partyTiming.js`) — flagQuiz's correct-fast / wrong-slow feel. The reveal shows **no
  timer at all** (a first pass tried a draining bar; a sub-second drain read as a flicker, so it
  was cut — only the question phase has a bar). On a wrong pick, the flag/outline you chose gets
  a country-name strip so you learn what you clicked — the shared `.opt.wrong[data-name]::after`
  rule promoted to `common.css` from flagQuiz. Single-player mode was also removed this round of
  work — Flag Party is one online path, start with 1+ (see PR #768).
- **Iteration 4 — the Map round.** Second round type ("Which outline is X?"), the mirror of
  flag-pick: same grid / buzz-order / scoring, tiles render pre-generated country contours
  (`flags/contours/`) instead of flags. Server now picks round modules from the plan via a
  `ROUNDS` registry (`flagPick` + `mapPick`), not hardwired flag-pick. Default game is 11 rounds
  (3 sovereign flag / 3 non-sovereign flag / 5 sovereign map). `flags/partyPlan.js` is the config
  surface the future settings page will edit.
