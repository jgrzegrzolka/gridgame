/**
 * The "superlative" round: "Which of these four flags is the *most* (or *least*)
 * populous?" — the third mirror of flag-pick. The prompt is a direction token
 * (`'most'` / `'least'`) rather than a target country, the options are four
 * flag codes, and the answer is whichever of the four the population metric
 * ranks at the extreme. Same `{ prompt, options, answer }` shape as flag-pick
 * and map-pick, so the room and scoring stay round-agnostic; the page renders
 * the options as flags (`flags/svg/<code>.svg`), exactly like flag-pick.
 *
 * This is the first round whose answer is *not* derivable from what the client
 * is shown (four flags with no numbers) — that's why the round contract keeps
 * the answer server-side. The only genuinely new logic here is picking four
 * countries with a clear extreme (below).
 *
 * The metric is built once, at module load, from `flags/metrics/population.json`
 * — the self-contained pattern `mapPick.js` uses for `CONTOUR_CODE_SET`. This
 * module runs *only on the server* (PartyKit; the page never imports it), so the
 * browser "fetch JSON, never import" rule doesn't apply — a static JSON import
 * is fine here, the way `party/partyGameServer.js` imports `countries.json`.
 * `createMetric` needs no country list for world-scope value lookups (`has` /
 * `valueOf` read the `values` map directly), so we pass `[]`.
